Expected Output: csv file with images and its absolute path, image score and elapsed time in secs. <br>

#### Install:<br>
`pip3 install imagescore`

#### How to run:<br>
`imagescore --infile 'input.csv' --outfile 'output.csv'`

#### The options are:<br>

        --infile  | -i [str]    -- [Input file path]
        --outfile | -o [str]    -- [Output file path]
        --height  | -h [int]    -- [Optional: height to be resized, default = 4096]
        --width   | -w [int]    -- [Optional: width to be resized, default = 4096]

#### Developer mode: <br>
The application is written in python3. Hence create a virtualenv with python3 and install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`. 
```
virtualenv --python=python3 venv
pip install -e .
```

The unit test cases are located in tests directory. Install the dependencies `requrements-dev.txt`. 
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
tox
```

#### Deployment: <br>
The python package is build with the travis.yml script when there are changes on the master branch. 
To push a new version:
Make the changes in the application, push it to any feature branch and merge with master.<br>
To deploy a new version tag it. e.g 
```
git tag -a v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```
When a tag is pushed, travis starts building and uploading the application to pypi<br>
